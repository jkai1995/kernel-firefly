Binding for Rockchip's CPUFreq driver
===============================

Rockchip's CPUFreq driver attempts to read SoC version and leakage values
from eFuse, then supplies the OPP framework with 'prop' and 'supported
hardware' information respectively. This is based on operating-points-v2,
but the driver can also create the "cpufreq-dt" platform_device to
compatibility with operating-points.

For more information about the expected DT format [See: ../opp/opp.txt].

Optional properties:
In 'operating-points-v2' table:
- leakage-voltage-sel: The property is an array of 3-tuples items, and
               each item consists of leakage and voltage selector like
               <min-leakage max-leakage volt-selector>.
               min-leakage: minimum leakage in mA, ranges from 1 to 254
               max-leakage: maximum leakage in mA, ranges from 1 to 254
               voltage-selector: a sequence number which is used to math
               opp-microvolt-L<number> roperty in OPP node
- nvmem-cells: A phandle to the soc_version and cpu_leakage data provided
               by a nvmem device.
- nvmem-cell-names: Should be "soc_version" and "cpu_leakage"

Examples:

cpus {
	cpu@0 {
		operating-points-v2 = <&cluster0_opp>;
	};
}

cluster0_opp: opp_table0 {
	compatible = "operating-points-v2";
	opp-shared;
	leakage-voltage-sel = <
		1   24   0
		25  254  1
	>;
	nvmem-cells = <&cpu_leakage>;
	nvmem-cell-names = "cpu_leakage";

	opp@216000000 {
		opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <216000000>;
		opp-microvolt = <950000 950000 1350000>;
		opp-microvolt-L0 = <1050000 1050000 1350000>;
		opp-microvolt-L1 = <950000 950000 1350000>;
		opp-suspend;
	}
};
